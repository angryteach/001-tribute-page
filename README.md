# 001-tribute-page
First project-based work for "Responsive Web Design" from freeCodeCamp

## Purpose
Using the skills learned I had to put together a single page as a static website using HTML5 and CSS3 only.
The page had to resemble [this page](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).

## Target audience
This is for anyone interested to start in web development. Study the source and then play with the code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/angryteach_dev/pen/GRMgqgv).

## Things you'll learn
1. Basic HTML layout
2. Basic CSS styling
3. flex, DIVs, IDs, images, lists and blockquote
